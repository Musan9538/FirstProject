/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS (and SCSS, if configured) file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file. Optionally, you can also load any individual CSS, SCSS, or SASS files using a
 * separate file, per directory, or specify a glob (e.g. *.scss) that'll be compiled together.
 *
 * @import "bootstrap";
